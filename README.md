## Compositional stability of sediment microbial communities during a seagrass meadow decline
This is the repository for the manuscript "Compositional stability of sediment microbial communities during a seagrass meadow decline" written by Marsej Markovski, Mirjana Najdek, Gerhard J. Herndl and Marino KorleviÄ‡. The raw sequencing data with the exception of negative controls have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession numbers SAMEA11293274 - SAMEA11293412 and SAMEA6648825. Negative control samples are part of this repository and are located in data/raw/. To be able to reproduce the results the mothur compatible SILVA reference file (Release 138.1, available under a [CC-BY license](https://www.arb-silva.de/silva-license-information/)) must be created according to instruction given on [the mothur blog](https://mothur.org/blog/2021/SILVA-v138_1-reference-files/) and in the Makefile. This README file contains an overview of the repository structure, information on software dependencies and instructions how to reproduce and rerun the analysis.

#### Running analysis
Before running the analysis be sure to generate the mothur compatible SILVA reference file and indicate in the Makefile its location. The manuscript and supplementary information can be generated on a Linux computer by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/MicrobesRovinj/Markovski_SalineSediment16S_x_2022.git
cd Markovski_SalineSediment16S_x_2021/
make submission/manuscript.pdf
```
If something goes wrong and the analysis needs to be restarted run the following command from the project home directory before rerunning the analysis:
```
make clean
```
